        	The EMS search function is extremely versatile, allowing users to effortlessly
        	create precise search queries for almost any criteria imaginable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Search conditions are split into three parts: the field to check, the type of
        	comparison to perform, and the value to compare against. The field and
        	comparison type are both selectable from a drop-down menu, and the whole
        	condition forms a statement in plain English, such as "First name starts with
        	John".
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	When the search dialog opens, it contains only one search condition. The
        	<b>+</b> button below the list adds another condition, and the <b>-</b> button removes
        	the <i>last</i> condition. Search queries must always contain at least one
        	condition.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	By default, searches will return employees that match <i>all</i> of the given
        	conditions. To instead find employees that match <i>any</i> condition, use
        	the drop-down menu above the list.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	To clear a search and display all employees in the database, select the <b>Show
        	all</b> option in the <a href="MainWindow.htm">main window</a>.
