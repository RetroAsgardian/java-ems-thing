		<h1>The Employee Window</h1>
		<p>
			The employee window allows you to view and edit an employee's details, convert
			them from a full-time employee to a part-time employee or vice versa, and
			delete them from the database.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Unable to save?</h2>
		<p>
			If the Save button is disabled, the employee has either not been edited, or is
			in an invalid state. Ensure that none of the fields have been left blank, and
			if the employee is part-time, that their hourly pay is not set below minimum
			wage ($15/hour).
